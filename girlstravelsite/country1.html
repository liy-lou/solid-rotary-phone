                                                    people of Cambodia were incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I
                                                    loved learning about their culture and traditions. The food was also
                                                    amazing, with plenty of delicious local dishes to try. Overall, I

                                                    expecting. While the temples of Angkor were impressive, the rest of

                                                    overwhelming and made it difficult to enjoy any part of the trip.
                                                    Additionally, the constant harassment by touts and beggars made it
                                                    hard to relax and enjoy my surroundings. Overall, I was disappointed
                                                    by my experience in Cambodia and would not recommend it as a travel

                                <p>There are many cultural customs to be aware of in Cambodia. Here is some brief

                                    <li>The food is a must try in Cambodia! With flavours similar to its Southeast Asian
                                        neighbours Thailand and Vietnam, you can expect bursts of flavour in street
                                        foods
                                        and
                                        stalls. Although meat is consumed widely throughout the country, it is possible
                                        to
                                        find
                                        Buddhist vegetarian cuisine as well as halal food places owned by Cham
                                        Cambodians,
                                        who
                                        practice Islam. If you have allergies, please exercise caution as cross
                                        contamination
                                        can be an issue, and be especially careful at street food stalls as hygiene
                                        standards
                                        are not as robust as other nations.</li>
                                    <li>The national religion of Cambodia is Theravada Buddhism, which influences many
                                        aspects
                                        of daily life. Beautiful, picturesque temples are dotted all over the country
                                        and
                                        are
                                        worth visiting, especially UNESCO World Heritage Site Angkor Wat in Siem Reap.
                                        Monks
                                        are
                                        highly respected in Cambodian society, and its common for young men to spend
                                        some
                                        time
                                        in a monastery as a rite of passage. It is important to know that it is polite
                                        etiquette
                                        to show respect to monks, with women to avoid physical contact with them.</li>
                                    <li>Cambodia is a conservative society, with high emphasis on family, religion and
                                        tradition. Public displays of affection, revealing clothing especially at
                                        temples is
                                        to
                                        be avoided. When visiting someone's home or temple, remember to remove your
                                        shoes
                                        before
                                        entering.</li>
                                    <li>The language of Cambodia is Khmer! It is worth learning a few phrases to help
                                        you
                                        out,
                                        and the locals will appreciate your effort. Don't worry if you are struggling
                                        though,
                                        there are many places, especially in the capital Phnom Penh, where locals speak
                                        English.

                                    <li>Avoid walking alone at night: It's generally not recommended to walk alone at
                                        night,
                                        especially in areas that are unfamiliar to you. Stick to well-lit and busy areas
                                        and
                                        consider using transportation such as taxis or tuk-tuks.</li>
                                    <li>Use reputable transportation: If you're taking a taxi or tuk-tuk, make sure to
                                        use a
                                        reputable company or have your hotel or hostel arrange transportation for you.
                                        Avoid
                                        taking unmarked or unregistered vehicles.</li>
                                    <li>Stay in a safe accommodation: Choose accommodation that is located in a safe and
                                        well-lit area. Look for hotels or hostels that have good reviews, secure
                                        entrances,
                                        and
                                        24-hour staff.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid excessive alcohol consumption: Drinking too much alcohol can impair your
                                        judgment
                                        and make you more vulnerable to unsafe situations. Drink responsibly and be
                                        mindful
                                        of
                                        your surroundings.</li>
                                    <li>Be aware of scams: Be cautious of scams that target tourists, such as tuk-tuk
                                        drivers
                                        who offer to take you to "secret" temples or shops. Stick to reputable tour
                                        operators
                                        and do your research before committing to any deals.</li>
                                    <li>Trust your instincts: If you feel uncomfortable in a situation, trust your

                                        and
                                        remove yourself from the situation. Don't be afraid to ask for help from locals
                                        or
                                        seek
